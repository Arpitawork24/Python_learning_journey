In python, we know that we can use 'else' with 'if' loop; but => we can also use 'else' with 'for' nd 'while' loops too.
In Python, the 'is' operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory. 
If a Python function has no return statement, it automatically returns None (not a error).
In Python, functions can return other functions, and the returned function retains access to the outer function’s variables through closures.
