# Counter is a tool in Python that helps you count how many times each item appears in a list, string, or other collection. (keep C of Counter uppercase).

from collections import Counter

num = [1,2,1,3,4,2,5,2,1,5]
num_ct = Counter(num)
print(num_ct)

# Accessing count of an element
print(num_ct[1])
print(num_ct[3])
print(num_ct[8])


word = "banana"
word_ct = Counter(word)
print(word_ct)

#update a Counter
numb = Counter([1,2,5,2,1,3,6])
numb.update([2,3,5,6,3,7,2,3])
print(numb)
